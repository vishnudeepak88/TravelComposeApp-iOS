#  Project Context

## Overview

- iOS 26 SwiftUI app targeting iPhone and iPad
- Minimum deployment: iOS 26
- Swift 6 with strict concurrency
- Uses SwiftUI throughout - no UIKit unless absolutely necessary

## Architecture

- MVVM with @OBservable ViewModels (NOT observableObjects)
- Views on their ViewModel as a @State property
- ViewModels handle all business logic - Views are declaritive only
- Navigation uses NavigationStack with NavigationPath - never NavigationView
- Dependency injection through the SwiftUI Enviroment
- use AppStorage for simple user prefernces
- use SwiftData for persistent models

## Build System
- use BuildProject for completion (not shell commands or xcodebuild)
- Previews are available via RenderPreview
- SPM for package management - no CocoaPods
- Build target: "MyApp" iOS

## Testing
- Use Swift Testing framework -- NOT XCTest
- Test functions use @Test attribute, not func textXYZ()
- Use #expect() for assertions - not XCTAssertEqual
- Test target: CLAUDEmdTests
- Run with RunAllTests or RunSomeTests MCP tools


## Documentation & APIs
- Use DocumentationSearch for Apple API questions
- Do NOT hallucinate API names - Verify with the docs first
- prefer async/await - never completion handlers
- use structured concurrency (TaskGroup) over manual task management
- Error handling: use typed throws where supported

## Code Style
- All new views must include a #Preview Block
- Use SF symbols for icons - reference by exact name
- Prefer Liquid Glass materials for iOS 26 UI
- File organization: one type per file
- Naming: PascalCase for types, cameCase for properties
- Group files by feature, not by type (Weather/, Profile/, Settings/)
